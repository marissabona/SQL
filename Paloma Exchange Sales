--AN EXAMPLE OF CODE I USE TO ORGANIZE AND ANALYZE THE SALES DATA FOR MY RESALE STORE IN BUFFALO, NY
--My store produces a lot of data. We buy from the public daily, so we have to understand our inventory
--on a deep analytical level. In order to inform my buyers as to what's selling well and what we should
--continue to purchase from our customers, I use SQL to organize and analyze monthly sales data. I then
--present this data to our team, we formulate additional questions about it, and I continue to analyze
-- the data and repeat this process.
